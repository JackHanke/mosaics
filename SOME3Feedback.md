# SOME3 Feedback
A list of feedback received on the associated video.

## Feedback 1
I don't have any critiques; the video is excellent. I agree with the premise that it is important to have backburner problems. I would also extend this to other fields, other than mathematics. It is much easier to apply and understand a new technique on a topic or a problem that you are already familiar with.

## Feedback 2
Excellent discussion of the idea of “back burner questions” and why they can be useful to drive further learning and exploration. Good use of animation, the gas stove burner ignition sound might be too subtle a joke for some but I liked it. Too much “dead air” both silences and black screens, especially when both happen at the same time. The overall pace could be improved by quicker narration and less blank screen time. When the video finished I found myself rooting for you to find a general solution, so you must have done something right to make that kind of connection.

There are scribbles, and there are paintings, and there are works of art, and there are *masterpieces*, and there is *this video*. I can't express without hyperbole just how much I love every detail, every *facet* of this work. The context, the progression, the message, the script, the visuals, the tone, the *everything* is not just magnificently warm and inviting, but memorable in the greatest possible way. It feels strange to praise the actual problem, since it wasn't "intentional" the way other choices in this video are, but I can't help myself. It's so utterly perfect. It's easy to understand, it's easy to appreciate from a visual standpoint and even more so from a mathematical one, it's easy to see how simple it is and how fathomlessly complex it is. I'm going to be thinking about the mosaic problem for a while, I think. My one piece of ## Feedback is to include the length of time you worked (or have been working) on this problem for. It's dangerously easy as a viewer of *any* math to think that it's easy, that since it can be summarized in 20 odd minutes, it couldn't have taken the creator more than a few days or a few weeks *tops* to work through it all, when this is almost never the case. Adding in this duration can help your audience walk away not just with the idea of a backburner problem, but the reassurance that it will come slowly, and that's part of the fun of it. Overall, an indescribably perfect and important video from the very first moment down to the very last. You easily, *easily* have my vote. Good luck in SoME3, and I hope (and, possibly, anticipate) to see you in the top 5

## Feedback 4
Already saw your video as I was checking out the SoME3 entries before the voting. The only thing I have to say about this entry is just wow... I hope this ends up winning and I hope you keep making more videos and see you next year (If there will be a SoME4). You have my vote!

## Feedback 5
Excellent. Fulfills all criteria perfectly.

## Feedback 6
-Motivation: I am not currently a math major but I like that you framed this a relevant to people's math careers and as a tool to provide motivation for stuff. -Explanation: I think ur explanation was well done. Explaining counting is always tricky and I've never found any explanation of it satisfying, but you still did a really good job explaining the problem and tying it in to your original motivation. Also good decision to skip the explanation of generating function lol, cuz those are an absolute nightmare to explain. -Originality: Very original. Have never seen this problem. -Length: Length was pretty good. -Overall: I really like this video. I always have a soft spot for problems like this because I'm a big discrete math nerd, so I may be biased. I also really enjoyed you giving a reason for the math besides the math!

Motivation is interesting but may appeal only to a specific audience (math students). You could have explained the Inclusion-Exclusion principle (and formula) more clearly by giving it more time and examples. Your backburner problem is an original idea. Sometimes the pacing is too fast and some logical steps are skipped. Overall inspiring video but hard to follow.

## Feedback 8
This video is really well made. Well motivated, clear, concise, well explained. Amazing work my firend!

## Feedback 9
Backburner projects are definitely an interesting concept. I perhaps go the other way and try to invent a problem to solve when I get a new technique, but I always enjoy different perspectives. Thanks for sharing. The animation was clean, loved your working hard face!

## Feedback 10
You just put into words something I never realised had been helping me so much for so long. Backburner problems have made me go "aha" so many times, and, now that I think about it, are one of the best parts of learning mathematics. Thank you

## Feedback 11
This video was interesting to watch, and it provides a key lesson for an undergraduate student - providing motivation for all the abstract topics that get introduced in classes, especially those you haven't seen before. I just felt the video was a little too long for my taste, but the message and the problem covered made it a joy to watch.

## Feedback 12
This is one of the better videos. Motivating, original, good presentation.

## Feedback 13
This is a great video. I really enjoyed your story-like structuring and the red thread throughout the video. All the steps were logical and it flowed nicely. If I do have to be nitpicky, I think you could have explained a bit more thoroughly the connection between your courses and the problem at hand, for example, the inclusion-exclusion principle. Also, I think you are actually underselling backburner problems a bit, there are certainly more advantages: They are often even by themself entertaining (I also always take a pencil and paper on a flight :) ) and they motivate self-study of additional/advanced material. Sometimes they provide ideas for bachelor/master thesis. They can be great for socializing with other mathematicians. Often, they motivate repetition of already learned concepts, which most people, myself included, do not do often enough. All in all a very good video with little potential for improvement!

## Feedback 14
Nice story! Your mosaic problem is certainly original. I'm surprised your counts for 2-by-n mosaics don't appear in OEIS!

## Feedback 15
Really a very interesting video. It feels like it is going to be one that you will remember. Nice visuals and very clear explanation, not only for the math problem but also in the topic of a back burner problem. I really enjoyed it.

## Feedback 16
Perfect video. I liked the motivation and was instantly hooked, since I know a lot of people who struggle with the material they learn, me included. This is a perfect solution for getting more engaged in the subject. The problem is very fitting for the video format and how easy it is to show what you mean by animation. I loved the connection drawn to the inclusion-exclusion principle and then moving on to generating functions. This is a kind of video, which I will certainly not forget and will try to implement myself. The idea is rather original and the use of the concepts are very fitting. It also has the perfect length, since it's not too long so that you get bored and it's also not too short. He even gave ideas to further explore this concept of mosaics, which is nice.

## Feedback 17
This entry is honestly, *very* good! The whole idea of a "backburner" problem actually sounds like a great idea, and is well motivated, and you can easily see *why* it's useful. The length is also in my "good range" and went pretty smoothly.

## Feedback 18
The video motivates itself by talking about math motivation in general but also about it's own problem, guiding the viewer throughout the process. Since the video focuses on the process of exploring a problem (and reasons to do so) as well as resolving the problem itself, i think it lacks the proper explanation about the actual solving process. The video have great visuals, switching between it's own animations and helpful representations on what is being explained. It also brings an interesting topic that's not very explored by the comunity. The video's length is relatively short, but it's still able to explain the points brought. Overall it's a very great video, with helpful and pleasing visuals, that talks about a big problem in studying math, the motivation and having something to motivate you.

## Feedback 19
I quite like that, even when using manim for the animations, with that 3b1b look, you were able to give your different feel by changing the color scheme and adding some sound effects and drawings, which makes the video have its look. I also like how the video isn't just about maths, it goes over how to approach maths, in some way. While at first 17' may seem long, the explanations and your tone is great, so it doesn't come out as a long video plus, in today's shorter and shorter video, is great to have an slow pace, you don't rush the explanation and there is enough time to think about what you're saying. Overall this was a great video.

## Feedback 20
Have a feeling this video is going to be at least an honorable mention, because like, it's so good! I've only really had backburner 'concepts' that I've wanted to see explained and not problems to do, so I'm considering thinking about that more now. I don't think I have any critique I could give for this, just like, oh boy in other videos I'd love to see you introduce the topics you talk about with reference to each part of the things you talked about regarding this problem. Hope your partner knows the drawings were lovely ^_^

## Feedback 21
Love the intention of this video. Do Math you are interested in and all math will become more interesting! Thanks for the video and introducing this fun problem.

## Feedback 22
Nice background story and well explained. Good length and a topic I never thought about. The solution is rather nice and makes me want to know more about!

## Feedback 23
Excellent example of a backburner project! Not only for pure maths useful, but also for many graduate courses in physics. Having a small side project or thought experiment whilst taking the course can be so incredibly useful. Explained well and the length of the video was also great.
